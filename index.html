    <h1 style="background: red;">The Curious and Confusing Victorians</h1>

    <p>
        The Victorians was an era of love and hate. On one side you had the side of children dying from poverty but on one side they invented things like working toilets and using intelligence in the police.
    </p>
    <p>
        The benefit system was not even in existence back then.If you were poor then you or the whole family would work at a
        young age of 6 years old!
        The Queen back then was called Queen Victoria the second longing monarch in history (the first reigning monarch
        is Queen Elizabeth our current Queen.)
    </p>
    <p>
        When you were on the filthy streets of London you would have a chance overnight of being caught and chucked into
        the evil dreadful workhouse. You would be eating food worse than uncooked mutton [there are a few books that
        talk about the workhouse like 'Street child and Oliver Twist],you should go and check them out! 
        Another aspect to Victorian life is that the rich and te poor are compared massively.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you were poor you would live in a very small apartment and rich you live in a luxery off the streets of
        London. You would rarely ever need to do things by yourself because you would have maids and slaves [even though
        slavery was abolished round the time when Queen Victoria was crowned Queen. Although all of this treacherous
        stuff happened there are a few bonuses to the Victorians like: new inventions check first couple of sentences
        (if you want to see a couple of inventions) the inventions that intelligent iventors make were photograph
        safety bicycle and electric lightbulb  .
