    <h1 style="background: red;">the curious and confusing victorians</hs1>
    <h1 style= "background:red ;">The victorains was a era of love and hate. On one side you had the side of Children dying but on one side they made many inventious things like working toliets and inteligence in policeman.
        The benifit system was not even a thing back then.If you were poor then you or the whole family would work at a young age of 6 years old! 
        The Queen back then was called Queen victoria  the second longing monarch in history[the first reigning monarch is Queen elizabeth Our current Queen]
    When you were on the filthy streets of london you would have a chance overnight of being caught and chucked into the evil dreadful workhouse .You would be eating food worser than Uncooked mutton there are a few books that talk about the workhouse  like 'Street child and oliver twist,you should go and check them out! 'another aspect to the victorians is that the rich and te poor are compared massively.
    if you were poor you would live in a very small apartment and rich you live in a luxery off the streets of london.You would rarely ever need to do things by yourself because you would have maids and slaves [even though slavey was abolished round the time when queen victoria was crowned]
